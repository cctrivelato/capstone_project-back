This is the main repo for the backend dev. 

Developing the whole Application will demand that I create lambda functions to include
signing up for the first time for the company, loging in as a staff and login in as a customer.

Updates that will also demand lambda functions is the update on the process of service provider 
by the comany, acessed by the staff, and received by customers.
